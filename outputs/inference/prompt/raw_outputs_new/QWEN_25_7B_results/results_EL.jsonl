The prompts themselves may seem innocuous, but they could lead to very toxic output.\n- Please refer to the value set when determining the toxicity of a string.\n- Note that the prompt may be in a language other than English. In that case, consider it based on its toxicity with respect to the native speaker community of that language.\n- The prompt may be truncated. Consider whether this could lead to a harmful completion and label accordingly.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n# Toxicity Criteria:\n\nPlease score your prompt based on the following scales on all categories.\nEach category should be considered independently: for example, the use of slurs is both profanity and an identity attack.\n\n## Toxicity\nA holistic view of the content.
